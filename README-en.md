# 💳 Credit Card Purchase App
📘 Portuguese version available: [README-pt.md](./README-pt.md)

This project is the **final application of the [Java: Working with Lists and Objects](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/java-trabalhando-listas-objetos) course**, part of the [Java Developer Path by Alura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/formacao-java). The goal was to put into practice key Java concepts like **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **list manipulation** through a functional shopping simulation.

## 🎓 About the Alura Java Path

The **“Learn to Program in Java with OOP”** path offers a complete introduction to Java development — from core language fundamentals to more advanced topics such as API consumption and exception handling.

Topics covered in the path:

- Java syntax and structure
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Collections and object lists
- File read/write
- Error handling with exceptions

## 🛍️ About the app

This app simulates a **credit card shopping experience**:

- The user sets a **credit card limit**
- Multiple purchases can be added (with description and value)
- The system checks if the limit allows the purchase
- All purchases are displayed **in descending order of value**
- Displays the **total spent** and **remaining balance**

---

## 🧠 Concepts implemented

- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (`CreditCard`, `Purchase` classes)
- ✅ Proper class responsibility and encapsulation
- ✅ Use of `LinkedList` to handle a collection of purchases
- ✅ Custom sorting using `Comparable` and `Collections.sort()`
- ✅ Code modularization with clean, reusable methods
- ✅ Formatted output with purchase summaries and totals
- ✅ Input validation and balance logic

---

## 🧹 Personal goal

Beyond meeting the project requirements, I aimed to **build clean, well-structured and readable code**, following best practices in Java development.  
This project served as a great step forward in my journey as a Java developer. 💪
